            <section>
              <p>An incredibly well rounded developer, my breadth of experience allows me to wear many hats simultaneously while maintaing control, poise, and balance in all situations. I take pride in being an incredible debugger and reverse engineer by identifying solutions that are obvious, though not always apparent. Throughout my career, I am constantly pushing myself out of my comfort zone in order to improve my own abilities, my colleagues, and my work product. I am also a humble spirited person who would rather see the team or community succeed over an individual.</p>

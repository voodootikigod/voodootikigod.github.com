Every time I sit down to write a post it ends up turning towards geekery and then I am all the sudden 500 words in a discussion or rant that most of my friends don&#8217;t understand. Part of this is due to the past year, which in review I still have a hard time realizing all that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">happened</span> I was able to do. In hindsight, I view 2008 as the year that I completely let loose and did everything that I possibly could. I accomplished a lot, tried to do a lot of good (maybe succeeded, maybe failed), and wanted to pass on a couple things that you, my friends, might have missed or not known about. Here is my year in review, as best I can recollect it at least (Adam I leave to you to assign Happy Points).

For those of you who know me, I am sure that last one might have you scratching your head. Starting Jan 16, 2009 I am going to be working for a new company and putting Iterative Designs on the sidelines. The opportunity is a very exciting one and one that will do a lot of good for a lot of people. For as much as I learned and sometimes got burned this year, kicking off 2009 with this is going to be a huge shift. Having a &#8220;purity of mission&#8221; once again will be a great thing, one that already is rejuvenating and focusing me. I will keep you posted and hope to be writing more since I will (ideally) have more time.

I toasted out 2008, but really I am looking forward to 2009.

Thank you everyone who sat with me on this rollercoaster.

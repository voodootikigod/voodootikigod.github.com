<p>Over the weekend, I was able to get the JSConf.US 2010 site out and live. It has taken a fair bit of time to get the site perfect, although to the average visitor it might not seem as such. I decided that I would provide a little bit of insight about the working engine that is driving the new JSConf US 2010 site as people around the internet begin to dig for the buried treasure. The JSConf 2010 site is an early implementation of the "application side" of a crazy idea I had called <a href="http://github.com/voodootikigod/dissident">Dissident</a>. The intention of Dissident was to re-think the way of doing web applications to leverage the available bandwidth and client processing power within the modern dynamic of web browsing instead of "beefy servers". Essentially the concept is based around using entirely static content and pages that are "sprinkled" with dynamic content on the client side using JavaScript and RESTful Data APIs. While developing the site, I moved this concept a step further by integrating CouchDB inline as part of this process which does admittedly mutate the workflow, but I think for the better (mind you "for the better" is specific to this niche of a mainly public facing site).&nbsp;</p>

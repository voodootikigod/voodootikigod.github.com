				<p>The jquery-week-calendar plugin provides a simple and flexible way of including a weekly calendar in your application.&nbsp; It is built on top of jquery and jquery ui and is inspired by other online weekly calendars such as google calendar.&nbsp; If you require a monthly calendar view, I highly recommend checking out the <a href="http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/" target="_blank">FullCalendar</a> plugin by Adam Shaw.</p>
<h3>Calendar features at a glance</h3>
<p>The calendar features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display of calendar events within a weekly grid</li>
<li>Calendar events can be supplied as an array, url or function returning json</li>
<li>Calendar events can be dragged, dropped and resized</li>
<li>Lots of callbacks for customizing the way events are rendered plus callbacks for drag, drop, resize, mouseover, click etc</li>
<li>Automatically scrolls to current time</li>
<li>Extend the core calendar event data structure with your own data</li>
<li>Highly configurable, enabling variable timeslots, readonly calendars, display of partial days, custom date formatting, direct manipulation of individual events for create, update, delete of events and much more.</li>
</ul>
<div style=""><span><span><span><span><span><img title="calendar" src="http://www.redredred.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/calendar.jpg" height="257" alt="jquery week calendar" width="415" /></span></span></span></span></span><p>jquery week calendar</p></div>
<p>The design of the&nbsp; week-calendar plugin is not meant to be a total solution for managing weekly events as this would have limited it’s scope. For example it doesn’t impose a user interface approach for editing and updating calendar events.&nbsp; By providing the base weekly calendar api that is extensible, you will be able to create a much richer domain on top of the basic functionality. To help you achieve this, the calendar has plenty of hooks that make it quite simple to add this stuff in.</p>
<h3>Current Version</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/jquery-week-calendar/">The current version is 1.2.2</a></strong></p>
<h3>Live Demo</h3>
<p>The following live demonstration&nbsp; has a basic calendar with a few events in it. It demonstrates most of the major functionality by triggering events that are displayed as messages in the top right hand corner of the screen.&nbsp; More demos will&nbsp; come soon…</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/weekcalendar.html">Demo 1 (Basic)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Demo 1 shows basic calendar functionality. Calendar Events are supplied as a local javascript array. All triggered events are displayed as messages, calendar events in the past are shaded gray using the eventRender callback.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/weekcalendar_demo_2.html">Demo 2 (Multi data-source and dynamic config options)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Demo 2 allows you to select from two different data sources. These are both local javascript objects but could just as easily have come from a remote server. The data returned includes an ‘options’ property which overrides the default calendar options for ‘timeslotHeight’ and ‘timeslotsPerHour’.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><a href="http://jquery-week-calendar.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jquery.weekcalendar/full_demo/weekcalendar_full_demo.html">Demo 3 (Create / update / delete using jquery UI)</a></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This demo shows the use of jquery ui modal dialog for creating, updating and deleting events. It also demonstrates the use of
<ul>
<li>Staggered overlapping events</li>
<li>Querying the calendar for valid timeslots for a date to populate calendar event form select fields</li>
<li>Limited display of timeslots based on business hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As you may or may not know, this year we started out with a <a href="http://jsconf.us/2010.js">very risky web site concept</a>. Hailed by some as crazy and others as "elitist BS", either way it was pretty good filter for speakers. Some found it, others needed a little treasure map. Charles Jolley actually emailed us, provided a fitting description of himself, and asked how he could propose to speak. All we needed to say was "use web inspector" to which we received his one line response: "lol. &nbsp;clever." At that point, I knew he was the kind of speaker we were looking for. Charles is the creator of the now famous and widely used <a href="http://www.sproutcore.com">SproutCore</a>. SproutCore is the Rich Internet Application (RIA) framework at play in such applications as <a href="http://www.me.com">MobileMe</a> from Apple and <a href="https://bespin.mozillalabs.com/">Bespin</a> from <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Mozilla</a> (also a JSConf Sponsor 2 years running). Charles currently works for Apple as a senior front end architect, which is without a doubt an impressive title.</p>
<p>Charles plans on demonstrating the HTML5 love that SproutCore 1.1 comes packed to the brim with. Taking RIA and binding it with HTML5 - Brilliant! Charles also has some great things he is planning on demonstrating that will really blow your socks (or boots as the case maybe) off. This is going to be quite the presentation especially for building complex and very rich internet applications. We might even have some buccaneers with contrarian view points strategically placed in the audience to heckle him... You will have to be there to find out more!</p>

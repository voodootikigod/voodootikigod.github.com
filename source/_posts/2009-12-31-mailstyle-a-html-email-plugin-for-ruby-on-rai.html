      <blockquote><div>
  			<p><em>Note: MailStyle was originally called Shemail but was changed due to a general negative response to the name from the public.</em></p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Writing inline styles for HTML emails is dull and boring but unfortunately a necessary evil. Rather than do it by hand we thought it would be nicer to let our app do it for us. So we wrote <a href="http://github.com/purify/mail_style">MailStyle</a>.</p>
<h3>Enter MailStyle</h3>
<p><a href="http://github.com/purify/mail_style">MailStyle</a> allows you to write the css for your html emails as you normally would, then writes the styles inline when you send your emails. It also makes sure that your image paths are absolute rather than relative.</p>

    <p>First off, hilarious original name.</p><p>Second off, thank you to Jim Neath for making email styling less crappier than it actually is.</p></div>

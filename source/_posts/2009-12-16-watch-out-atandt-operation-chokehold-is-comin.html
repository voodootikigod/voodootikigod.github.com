      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><img src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2009/12/choke-1260879777.png" border="1" align="right" height="345" alt="" width="325" />After Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&amp;T Mobility, stated  earlier this week that he wants iPhone users to <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/12/09/att-de-la-vega/">limit their data usage</a> the <a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2009/12/iphone-caps/">web exploded with anger</a>. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/13/business/13digi.html?_r=1"><em>New York Times</em> sided with AT&amp;T</a>, but others thought that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/12/claim-that-crappy-iphone-service-is-apples-fault-is-bunkum.ars">was bogus</a>. Now Fake Steve Jobs is getting in on the <a href="http://www.fakesteve.net/2009/12/a-not-so-brief-chat-with-randall-stephenson-of-att.html">action</a>. Fake Steve is <a href="http://www.fakesteve.net/2009/12/operation-chokehold.html">telling iPhone users to go crazy</a> with their data usage this Friday, December 18, to teach De La Vega a lesson in for trying to stifle his customers contract-given-rights for unlimited data usage.<p />

<strong><em>Subject: Operation Chokehold</em></strong><em><br />
On Friday, December 18, at noon Pacific time, we will attempt to overwhelm the AT&amp;T data network and bring it to its knees. The goal is to have every iPhone user (or as many as we can) turn on a data intensive app and run that app for one solid hour. Send the message to AT&amp;T that we are sick of their substandard network and sick of their abusive comments. The idea is we'll create a digital flash mob. We're calling it in Operation Chokehold. Join us and speak truth to power!</em></blockquote>

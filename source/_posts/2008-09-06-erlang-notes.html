Through the various groups I am involved with, I have been learning Erlang for a little under three months, admittedly as more of a sideline learning than a full time. While learning about Erlang, I have picked up several notes, tips, and tricks that I have used to rapidly instruct people to at least my level of knowledge about this awesome upcoming language. I am going to write these items down here because people seem to find them useful and who am I to keep them hidden. I am going to try to post everything you need to really get started with Erlang in a fun and exciting manner. This is going to get crazy, so I encourage you to comment and I can try to help out. I am not going to recommend buying some book because to be completely honest all the books out right now do more to confuse than to instruct, which is why we had to get a group of 12 people together just to understand it. If you are looking to learn about Erlang, this is going to be the place -- well unless it sucks, then somewhere else is the place, try <a href="http://spawnlink.com/">here</a>.

<em>P.S.</em> I wish I had the drawing capabilities of <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">why the lucky stiff</a> then maybe I could pen a <a href="http://poignantguide.net/">poignant guide</a>, but alas I have but this simple blog and my notes.

      <blockquote class="posterous_long_quote"><p>Version 1.1 brings some substantial changes to <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/">jQuery BBQ</a>. I reorganized the plugin code substantially, which allowed the core <code>window.onhashchange</code> event functionality to be broken out into a separate <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/">jQuery hashchange event</a> plugin.</p>

<p>The end result is that while jQuery BBQ is still just as awesome as it’s always been, if you’ve wanted just a very basic, streamlined, normalized, cross-browser jQuery hashchange event without all the extra awesomeness that BBQ provides, it’s now available separately as <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/">jQuery hashchange event</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, BBQ now has a new <a href="http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/docs/files/jquery-ba-bbq-js.html#jQuery.bbq.removeState">$.bbq.removeState</a> method, which a few people have requested, as well as updated unit tests that utilize the most recent version of <a href="http://github.com/jquery/qunit" target="benalman2">QUnit</a>.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/">jQuery BBQ</a> project page as well as the new <a href="http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/">jQuery hashchange event</a> project page for more information, and let me know what you think!</p></blockquote>

    <p>Is there anything that the amazing Ben "Cowboy" Alman doesn't already have done? The judges think not.</p></div>

    <p>why the lucky stiff (or _why) is a computer programmer. His best known work may be Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby, a book which teaches the Ruby programming language with stories; its eclectic style has been compared to a "collaboration between Stanislaw Lem and Edward Lear". Chapter 3 of this Guide was republished in The Best Software Writing I, edited by Joel Spolsky.</p></div>

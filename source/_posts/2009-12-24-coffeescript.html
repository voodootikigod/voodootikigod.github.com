    <p>
      CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Think
      of it as JavaScript's less ostentatious kid brother — the same genes,
      roughly the same height, but a different sense of style. Apart from a handful of
      bonus goodies, statements in CoffeeScript correspond one-to-one with their
      equivalent in JavaScript, it's just another way of saying it.

      <b>Disclaimer:</b>
      CoffeeScript is just for fun and seriously alpha. I'm sure that there are still
      plenty of holes in the lexer and leaks in the syntax. <i>There is no guarantee,
      explicit or implied, of its suitability for any purpose.</i> That said,
      it compiles into clean JavaScript (the good parts) that can use existing
      JavaScript libraries seamlessly, and passes through
      <a href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> without warnings. The compiled
      output is quite readable — pretty-printed, with comments
      preserved intact.

    <p>Looks pretty darn impressive, a fair amount of discussion about using JavaScript as a compilation target, but that seems to be a trend. Objective-J, CoffeeScript, interesting world we live in.</p></div>

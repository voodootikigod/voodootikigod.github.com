<p>I recently received an email that made me quite happy. I have been accepted as a speaker to <a href="http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/conference/index.html">The Ajax Experience conference</a> in Boston, MA September 14-16, 2009. It is a huge honor to be presenting my hair-brained crazy idea of <a href="http://github.com/voodootikigod/dissident">Dissident</a> at the conference. The Ajax Experience is one of the big conferences in the web development space which I was planning on going to regardless, but was lucky enough to be selected as part of their lightning round -- at 9:00AM -- the first day. I will be laying down the mind altering craziness of Dissident faster than you can say "wait, didn't you curate <a href="http://www.jsconf2009.com">JSConf</a> - and what does curate even mean". For those of you unfamiliar with Dissident, it is my vision (and eventual implementation, but for now vaporware) of "Cloud Computing" that includes and embraces clients as first class and highly participatory members of the "web". Think of it as Rich Internet Applications (or RIA) on crack covered with syrup, served with a side of smoked applewood bacon (hmm bacon) and hash browns <a href="http://www.wafflehouse.com">smothered, covered, capped, diced, AND TOPPED</a>, and a pint of scotch on to wash it down.</p>
<p>Yea, that hot.</p>
<p>If you haven't done so yet, <a href="http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/conference/index.html">you should sign up</a>. It will be a grand time.&nbsp;</p>

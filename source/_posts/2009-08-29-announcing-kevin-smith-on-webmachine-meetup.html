<p>Its a bit late, but in a little under two weeks, Kevin Smith will be up in the Northern Virginia area and presenting on the powerful Erlang-based <a href="http://bitbucket.org/justin/webmachine/wiki/Home">webmachine</a> REST Toolkit on September 10, 2009. I have had the pleasure to meet and <a href="http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/?p=391">hang out with Kevin previously</a>&nbsp;and I can promise you that this meeting is one not to miss you have any interest in highly scalable and highly capable web environments. In case you think you have never heard of Kevin Smith, or maybe have him confused with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/">someone in the entertainment business</a>, let me introduce you to him and the wonders of Erlang. Kevin is based out of Raleigh, NC and runs his own company, <a href="http://www.hypotheticalabs.com/">Hypothetical Labs</a>, after recently leaving the great <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a>. He is responsible for introducing a large portion of the Ruby on Rails world to the <a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice">power, beauty, and capability of Erlang through his Pragmatic Programmer Screencast series</a>, which to this day still remains the best way to learn erlang (minus the Hands On Erlang class that he needs to do again). I have verified his "NOVALANG" ability and believe that his talk and the impending happy hour to one of the highest points of the DC technology scene - you have to be there!</p>
<p>The combined forces of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">NOVALANG</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/erlang/members/">Erlang Users of Arlington/DC</a>, and Alt.NET DC are presenting this great presentation to you hosted by the great people at <a href="http://www.fool.com">The Motley Fool</a>. The meeting will begin on at 7:00pm at 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314 and will be followed with a happy hour(s), so bring your NOVALANG adult beverage face. Hope to see you there, I will be posting an intro to Erlang so people are completely lost -- hopefully sometime this weekend, but more likely next weekend.</p>

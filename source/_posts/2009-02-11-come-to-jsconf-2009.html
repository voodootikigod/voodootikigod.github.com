<p>As you may know from previous posts, I am arranging JSConf 2009 which is shaping up to be one amazing conference focused&nbsp;around JavaScript in all forms. We have arranged some of the greatest visionaries and&nbsp;developers within the JS community from John Resig of jQuery to Jason Huggins from&nbsp;Selenium testing environment. This is an incredible opportunity for anyone doing web&nbsp;based development regardless of the language. JSConf 2009 will be held in Arlington, VA&nbsp;between April 24 and 25, 2009, which makes it a great local event for everyone in the&nbsp;region. The conference brings together 16 speakers to present on JavaScript development&nbsp;in the browser, mobile, desktop, and server environments. If you haven't had much of a&nbsp;chance to do some deep JavaScript work, but have done Java development, this conference&nbsp;is the best way to learn from some of the best. Although many people don't realize it,&nbsp;JavaScript can also be used to build thick client desktop applications. In addition, it is one&nbsp;of the only languages to successfully bridge object oriented and functional programming&nbsp;in a way that anyone can use it.</p>
<p>We are keeping the conference small and intimate so you will be able to interact with the&nbsp;speakers and attendees during the day and during the social events. The conference costs&nbsp;$450 right now for two days worth of speakers, breakfasts, lunchs, and a beer and wine&nbsp;tasting. If you are looking for more work, this conference has also drawn the attention of a&nbsp;lot of hiring employers who are looking for developers.</p>

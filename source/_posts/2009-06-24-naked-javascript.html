<p>I began writing on <a href="http://www.posterous.com">Posterous</a> for a new personal project that I am currently working on which will provide a series of posts about "<a href="http://www.nakedjavascript.com">Naked JavaScript</a>" or JavaScript without the DOM. The aspiration of this project is that I will post at least once a week (ideally twice a week) on the most interesting and hottest topics in JavaScript, specifically its use outside of the browser. I am just starting on this venture and want to fill the queue with interesting content and articles so that I can keep the hungry hordes of information goers (ahem, you) happy, so stay tuned to that feed as I am sure you will find some interesting items soon to come to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow, so I began using Posterous for that and decided to use it for more personal things as well, I haven't completely switched over from my standard one, but I am getting very close. The fact that the <a href="http://blog.posterous.com/posterous-is-the-best-way-to-publish-video-an-0">iPhone 3GS can post photos and videos</a> directly to the blog is a super sweet idea, and one that I am both excited and fretful about using. Anyhow stay tuned for future things to come and sorry about the crazy pictures and video posts earlier (since removed) I was testing out the functions and had no idea that it was posting to the various social networks (embarrassing).&nbsp;</p>

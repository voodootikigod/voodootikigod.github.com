			JavaScript: The Great Part</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Laura and I just wrapped up JSConf 2009, which <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=jsconf" title="Twitter Search: JSConf">evidently</a> <a href="http://www.michaelharrison.ws/weblog/?p=132">went</a> <a href="http://www.blueskyonmars.com/2009/04/27/jsconf-2009-the-best-conference-you-couldnt-attend/">over</a> <a href="http://www.subprint.com/blog/jsconf-2009-day-one/">very</a> <a href="http://www.subprint.com/blog/jsconf-2009-&amp;mdash;-day-two/">well</a>. We couldn&#8217;t be more happy with the way the conference went; the attendees, the speakers, the excitement, and the energy - it was the best conference we have ever been to, even though we spent most of the time running around. There was a lot of time and preparation that went into JSConf 2009 to ensure that each detail, each idea was carefully tailored to the community. For those of you that attended and those that were unable to, we will be posting the videos over the coming months - every presentation was amazing so be sure to check out all of them.</p>
<p>On to the focus of this post - the JavaScript community has long since taken a side saddle or back seat to other less capable and less prevalent languages. The presentations drew out the amazing genius and talent that happily and quietly thrives in the community. If you just look at the Track A sessions (listed on the <a href="http://www.jsconf2009.com/speakers.html">web site</a>) you will see that JavaScript spreads across mobile, data, desktop, testing, and its old familiar, the web. But its more than that, what you don&#8217;t see on the web site (yet) is the wonderful Track B and Hacker Lounge items that happened during JSConf 2009. The presentations in Track B were easily all on par with Track A and covered an even wider range of topics from typography to programmatic music generation to server side JavaScript.</p>
<p>That all said, the most amazing part of the conference was not the presentations. At this conference you had some of the smartest people in the programming world talking about a language that is unfortunately thought of as a necessary evil. Everyone was jovial, welcoming, friendly, and communal it was truly a community. There was no dominant &#8220;rockstar&#8221; that parade around overly proud of themselves, despite the amazing things that every individual in attendance has (and will further) accomplish. That is the greatest part of the JavaScript community - it is truly a thriving community flush with talented people. This doesn&#8217;t just include &nbsp;the speakers and attendees. The sponsors of JSConf - <a href="http://www.rga.com">R/GA</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a>, <a href="http://www.joyent.com">Joyent</a>/<a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun</a>, and <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> - were amazingly willing to turn down the &#8220;marketing&#8221; and instead embrace and grow the community. Their own spread of capabilities - Digital Agency, Web Company, Platform Providers, Search and Development Networks, respectively - shows the range and impact of JavaScript. The fact that there was 130 of the smartest, most driven, and widest ranging people and companies present at JSConf 2009 and each person you met was incredibly humble and friendly - that is how I know that this is the community I want to be a part of.</p>
<p>This was the first conference that actually turned and focused in on JavaScript, the programming language, so this was a unique experience and that may have a hand in the humility of all - most people in attendance barely knew more than 4 other people in attendance, so we all arrived forced to make new friends. There is something there, though, that makes me proud of this community; instead of shelling up attendees made a concerted effort to meet, greet, and build relationships with one another. This conference was more than just a single event or moment in time - we have started a revolution. We are building a better community because we, JavaScript developers, have the rare capacity to understand that there is more to learn from using many languages and concepts than to arrogantly assume ours is the best and only solution. I am not trying to decry the value, processes, or importance of other language communities, just making a stand that we should continue to grow the JS community with a focus on talent,&nbsp;humility, and&nbsp;cooperation.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[[posterous-content:qBnjvgeElAjlyymunbpv]]</p>
<p>We are JavaScript, we welcome you to join us for the ride!</p>

			Come to JSConf 2009</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As you may know from previous posts, I am arranging JSConf 2009 which is shaping up to be one amazing conference focused&nbsp;around JavaScript in all forms. We have arranged some of the greatest visionaries and&nbsp;developers within the JS community from John Resig of jQuery to Jason Huggins from&nbsp;Selenium testing environment. This is an incredible opportunity for anyone doing web&nbsp;based development regardless of the language. JSConf 2009 will be held in Arlington, VA&nbsp;between April 24 and 25, 2009, which makes it a great local event for everyone in the&nbsp;region. The conference brings together 16 speakers to present on JavaScript development&nbsp;in the browser, mobile, desktop, and server environments. If you haven&#8217;t had much of a&nbsp;chance to do some deep JavaScript work, but have done Java development, this conference&nbsp;is the best way to learn from some of the best. Although many people don&#8217;t realize it,&nbsp;JavaScript can also be used to build thick client desktop applications. In addition, it is one&nbsp;of the only languages to successfully bridge object oriented and functional programming&nbsp;in a way that anyone can use it.</p>
<p>We are keeping the conference small and intimate so you will be able to interact with the&nbsp;speakers and attendees during the day and during the social events. The conference costs&nbsp;$450 right now for two days worth of speakers, breakfasts, lunchs, and a beer and wine&nbsp;tasting. If you are looking for more work, this conference has also drawn the attention of a&nbsp;lot of hiring employers who are looking for developers.</p>
<p>If you are interested in going, I would recommend getting your tickets soon at&nbsp;<a href="http://jsconf2009.eventbrite.com/">http://jsconf2009.eventbrite.com</a> as they are selling quickly. For more information or&nbsp;other speakers, check the website at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jsconf2009.com/">http://www.jsconf2009.com</a> Thank you for your time and hope to see you at JSConf!</p>

			Relaxing on the Couch(DB)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>So I have one day off between running my company and working for the new company. It is bone chilling cold in DC so I decided to stay in and play with <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jchris/couchapp/tree/master">CouchApp</a>. CouchApp is a set of utilities that makes building standalone CouchDB based applications simple and easy. The goal of the project is to a loose framework that allows you to build and host applications within CouchDB, think of it as shared hosting where the &#8220;database&#8221; is the shared host for both data storage and file serving. Chris Anderson clearly notes in his README that this is clearly not for all purposes, in fact its probably not even for most purposes, but it does fit nicely in a &#8220;build a quick application for personal reasons&#8221; space so that&#8217;s where we are going to use it.  For this first post, I am going to walkthrough, in similar vain to the great <a href="http://danbenjamin.com/articles/2005/12/ruby_rails_lighttpd_mysql_tiger">Dan Benjamin</a> how to get started with CouchDB. We are going to be using the same layout as Mr. Benjamin does to install CouchDB, so be sure to read his &#8220;Paths&#8221; section and follow it, but the short of the matter is to ensure that a line like:  <code>export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH</code> is present in your appropriate profile (.bash_profile, .profile) file so you will be able to immediately execute the CouchDB system.</p>
<p><strong>Moving the Couch In</strong></p>
<p>First things first, we need to get CouchDB up and running. There are several resources on the internet that provide you with instructions, but for consolidation sake, here is the quick and dirty. You need to start by installing the dependencies for CouchDB, for OS X its very easy (and recommended) to do with <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a>. At a Terminal prompt enter the following line and go get a cup of coffee. It will take a bit of time.</p>
<p><code>sudo port install icu erlang spidermonkey curl</code></p>
<p>This will download and install all of the dependencies that you will need to install CouchDB properly. A quick break down of these so you know what you are getting is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>icu</strong> - international components for Unicode.</li>
<li><strong>erlang</strong> - A concurrent focused programming language that is worth <a href="http://www.erlang.org">checking out</a>.</li>
<li><strong>spidermonkey</strong> - A JavaScript implementation in C from <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/">Mozilla</a>.</li>
<li><strong>curl</strong> - Command line tool for <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">URL and URI handling</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the effort we are going to do, not hacking CouchDB, but hacking on top of CouchDB, we will use the official SVN base. If you want to hack on the CouchDB code base, check out this <a href="http://github.com/halorgium/couchdb/tree/master">git branch</a>. The code we are about to check out is the edge version of CouchDB. The last release was 0.8.1 and while its a solid and stable release, the edge version provides some great feature enhancements and new features that we will want to take advantage of. It is quite stable and solid in its own right, so don&#8217;t let &#8220;edge&#8221; scare you. The team is driving towards a 1.0 solid release in the coming months, so I recommend living on the edge for now and stabilize when the 1.0 is released.</p>
<p>To checkout the source, you will need <a href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/trunk/INSTALL">SVN</a>, but if you are reading this, I am going to assume you either have or had it installed for other projects. Enter the following code into the Terminal:</p>
<p><code>svn checkout http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/couchdb/trunk/ couchdb<br /> cd couchdb<br /> ./bootstrap &amp;&amp; ./configure --prefix /usr/local &amp;&amp; make<br /> sudo make install</code></p>
<p>This will checkout the current trunk of CouchDB to a folder called &#8220;couchdb&#8221; without the quotes, Enter that directory, the execute three commands in unison that will bootstrap, configure, and then make CouchDB. This may take some time (roughly 5 minutes on a modern computer). The final line will execute as a &#8220;privileged user&#8221; and install CouchDB to the /usr/local/ directory structure which is in our path.</p>
<p>To quickly run CouchDB, albeit not in the safest of manners - we will add safety later, enter the following command into your Terminal:</p>
<p><code>sudo couchdb</code></p>
<p>You should see output on the Terminal like this</p>
<p><code>Apache CouchDB 0.9.0a734728-incubating (LogLevel=info) is starting.<br /> Apache CouchDB has started. Time to relax.</code></p>
<p>This means that your CouchDB system is up and running. To verify this, point your web browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/">http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/</a> which is the impressive web based interface to CouchDB. This interface is similar in concept to packages you might have used to manage a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) like MySQL or PostgreSQL. The screen will look something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[[posterous-content:nqDtBxAdszstjpcvfhcm]]</p>
<p>In this interface, your databases and &#8220;work content&#8221; are on the left and your tools and database quick links are on the right. To create a database, you click the &#8220;Create Database&#8221; link in the top left corner. It uses some nice JavaScript techniques to provide you with a very rich interface for creating databases and documents. Let&#8217;s go ahead and create a new database called &#8220;sampledb&#8221; without the quotes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[[posterous-content:GJoyfxisaxcurrFuBezl]]</p>
<p>Then click the &#8220;Create&#8221; button. This will take you to the new database immediately. CouchDB is not like a traditional RDBMS in that instead of tables, columns, and rows, everything is just a document. Documents are a very powerful concept that is freeform and able to handle a wide variety of data. That said, documents are not for every type of domain. For a more in depth discussion and dive into CouchDB concepts, I highly recommend reading through the beta book, <a href="http://books.couchdb.org/relax/">Relax With CouchDB</a>. To quickly show you some of the neat things we can do with this database we just made, lets add a document using the &#8220;Create Document&#8221; link where the &#8220;Create Database&#8221; link was before.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[[posterous-content:pnzdtoGoADllhiIhECvr]]</p>
<p>As happened with the create database, there is a nice little pop-up, although for this one, we are just going to let CouchDB identify the document for us. I am purposefully glazing over what this ID does, but it is very fundamental in the shift to CouchDB, check out the aforementioned book for a full discussion on it. For now, just hit the &#8220;Create&#8221; button to use an auto-generated ID. Without even writing a line of code, we can quickly begin adding very rich and meaningful data into CouchDB. The diagram below shows a new field added (through the &#8220;Create Field&#8221; button) called &#8220;name&#8221; with the value of that field being a hash with keys for &#8220;first&#8221;, &#8220;middle&#8221;, and &#8220;last&#8221; and their values.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">[[posterous-content:ABksCindgkiBnpAAntwz]]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice its all stored as one, wrapped up, meaningful data field. We didn&#8217;t have to define a schema, then input based on the schema. The hash should look very similar to JavaScript you may have worked with because thats all it really is - JavaScript. All documents and fields are serialized to <a href="http://www.json.org/">JavaScript Object Notation</a> (JSON) and communicated to CouchDB. To save the document, press the &#8220;Save Document&#8221; button in the upper left corner. Until you save the document, all changes are local. This is key to note, there is no auto-saving going on so that you can build up your document and the flush all changes at once. Now that you have CouchDB up and running here are some quick exercises for you to try out some of the basic functionality. You should be able to accomplish these without any further knowledge then we have described above.</p>
<p><strong>Exercises</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Attach three different files to a document, make sure they are of different type and notice that you do not have to specify any structure or storage place for the files, its handled automatically for you.</li>
<li>Go back to the original version (&#8220;Previous Version&#8221;) and try to add a new field and save the change.</li>
<li>Create a field called friend with the value of your name.</li>
<li>Create a field called favorite colors that has an array of colors in the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).</li>
<li>Click on the &#8220;Source&#8221; tab and try to map the &#8220;Source&#8221; view to the &#8220;Fields&#8221; view. Having two browser windows open might help with this.</li>
<li>Delete the document.</li>
</ol>

Every time I sit down to write a post it ends up turning towards geekery and then I am all the sudden 500 words in a discussion or rant that most of my friends don&#8217;t understand. Part of this is due to the past year, which in review I still have a hard time realizing all that <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">happened</span> I was able to do. In hindsight, I view 2008 as the year that I completely let loose and did everything that I possibly could.

For those of you who know me, I am sure that last one might have you scratching your head. Starting Jan 16, 2009 I am going to be working for a new company and putting Iterative Designs on the sidelines. The opportunity is a very exciting one and one that will do a lot of good for a lot of people. For as much as I learned and sometimes got burned this year, kicking off 2009 with this is going to be a huge shift. Having a &#8220;purity of mission&#8221; once again will be a great thing, one that already is rejuvenating and focusing me. I will keep you posted and hope to be writing more since I will (ideally) have more time.

I toasted out 2008, but really I am looking forward to 2009.

Thank you everyone who sat with me on this rollercoaster.

		<p>Over the past several months that has been an increase in the number of blog entries and twitter messages about Ruby and while that is nothing new since Rails hit the scene, the tone of these messages are growing detectably darker. The past two days have bubbled up two posts, that I highly recommend reading, from people well respected in the community, <a href="http://hackety.org/2008/11/21/aCostlyParade.html">Why the Lucky Stiff</a> and <a href="http://kirindave.tumblr.com/post/60776407/the-opposite-of-momentum">Dave Fayram (KirinDave)</a>, which fall inline with similar posts from <a href="http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/07/brief-history-of-dangerous-ideas.html">Raganwald</a> and <a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">Zed Shaw</a>. While I agree with the full range of comments and thoughts described in these varied posts, there is a thread of disenchantment to them that,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;coming from <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">Why</a>, is very painful. These developers have built wonderful things within the community, pillars upon which most other elements now either stand or are greatly influenced.</p>
<p>I think the problem that most developers are running into is not about Ruby specifically, but about the &#8220;Gold Rush&#8221; mentality that we exude for each new programming language. Anytime there is something shiny and new, we are driven to it with vivid fascination and undoubtably we like what we see or we troll it, there rarely is a middle ground. If we like what we see, we try to get as engrained in the community as possible, looking for our chance at spotlight and greatness, seeking our project of worth. Sometimes that is monetary greatness, sometimes its respect, and often times its just being known. We are mostly driven by the desire to not let our programming skills go unnoticed and that we can change the world and do great things. When you are driven by such a motive, you have to realize that its hard to verify/validate that motive because it is an insatiable hunger that eventually begins to feed on itself. You will never have that concrete &#8220;This kick ass thing that you can hold and see on the lapels of friends is my idea&#8221; except in very rare cases (Twitter, Google, etc.). I am guilty of this myself, so by no means think otherwise.</p>
<p>I digress. The issues that people are running into with the Ruby community, personal observation, are not Ruby&#8217;s fault. The are the fault of an innate desire within developers to create. That desire has to be there to make us get up and converse with binary electrical equipment all day and toil with its incessant cryptic messages. We are Dr. Frankensteins. We need to continually experiment and push and when our material, our canvas, cannot sustain new experimentation we throw it out (in flames sometimes) and move to the new material that seems foreign, different, and exciting. And so &#8220;upstart&#8221; communities within technology sphere jump from one bandwagon to the next and have been doing so ever since we made technology in to a <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2008/11/smackdown-at-pro-rubyconf-08.html">religious war</a>.  Is vi better than emacs, who cares. Ruby vs Python, Python vs Java, Linux vs Windows &#8211; its too much for no benefit. People will use what they use, if its new and shiny and can help you, then use it. To clarify the linking is in no way meant to put Obie or his smackdown in ill terms, its just an example of how fractured people can become over little issues.</p>
<p>Hows about this, instead of banding together as a community of rubyists, cocoaheads, or erlangers and declaring all out war on anyone not in the community, why not claim ourselves to be polyglots and build a community around sharing. Languages should not be battle crys, they are materials with which we can create great things. Imagine if you <a href="http://github.com/ezmobius/nanite/tree/master">blended</a> <a href="http://github.com/KirinDave/fuzed/tree/master">languages</a> and the new creations you could make. What if the limitations of a language were reason for you to just look for something else and connect the two up. We need to get past &#8220;I am __________________ (Language User)&#8221; and focus on &#8220;I am a developer and will use anything to paint my masterpiece&#8221;.</p>
<p>And with this post, please pass the salt - thanks.</p>

			JSConf 2009</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		For several weeks I have been using <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/" title="TweetDeck">tweetdeck</a> as my standard client for Twitter, not because of any issue with <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">twitterriffic</a>, but for the integration of <a href="http://search.twitter.com">search.twitter.com</a> feeds. I have two feeds that I track - one for <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=erlang">Erlang</a> and one for <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=javascript">Javascript</a> - due to their importance to <a href="http://github.com/voodootikigod/dissident/tree/master">some of the projects</a> I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">am</span> wish I was working on. One thing I quickly realized is that there is still a tremendous amount of people who have strong angst against JavaScript and seem to think of it a &#8220;sub-language&#8221;. I found this almost impossible given all the amazing things JavaScript does and its wide proliferation in nearly every environment. JavaScript is a critical element of nearly every web application framework and has been around longer than almost all of them. It is a language that exemplifies some of the core problems of modern languages in an exacerbated fashion (platform differences, security models, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype-based_programming">prototype programming</a>, etc.) and does it in a fashion that most people can learn somewhat quickly, albeit not necessarily properly.

Then I began to think about other languages (<a href="http://ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/net/">.NET</a>, etc.) and quickly realized that part of what makes these languages widely known and spotlighted is their community of dedicated developers. These developers generally meet at conferences and by meeting with one another they increase the visibility and excitement surrounding the language. From the conference many projects are started, videos presented, blogs written, and general knowledge conveyed that otherwise remained pocketed. There are a few things I have learned in my conference trips:
<ul>
	<li>The more geographically and politically diverse the conference, the broader the knowledge base and wider spread of the change. </li>
	<li>The more dedicated the attendees, the more vibrant the culture and powerful the collaboration. </li>
</ul>
So I turned this light back into the JavaScript community and realized that as a JavaScript developers there is no core conference that just focuses on JavaScript. There are many that focus on the <a href="http://ajaxexperience.techtarget.com/">effects</a> or <a href="http://ajaxworld.com/">value</a> <a href="http://events.jquery.com/">adds</a> of JavaScript, but not one that I could find that focused strictly on JavaScript, the language. Furthermore, there are only a handful of JavaScript User Groups in the world, which considering the widespread use of JavaScript, developers seem to have a hard time to gather around it. 

From this realization, I decided to do something crazy and set up the first <a href="http://jsconf2009.com">JavaScript Conference</a> dedicated to deep JavaScript technology in all facets. I am trying to find speakers for everything from server side JavaScript to Processing.js to next generation technologies to security. Its a huge gamble, especially given the market factors, but I thought it was something that needed to be done. Since releasing the concept in the wild, I have learned some interesting things about the JavaScript community:
<ul>
	<li>NEVER USE THE WORD ROCKSTAR, OR IMAGERY OF A ROCKSTAR, OR THINK OF A ROCKSTAR. Just do not do it - I have corroborated this with other people in the community and its scary the results of this action.</li>
	<li>A lot of people agree with my contention that JavaScript deserves more attention and collaboration than it currently gets despite the huge number of tutorials, blogs, and documentation - one starts to think its a case of information overload and having to sort through it all becomes too cumbersome.</li>
	<li>The most exciting projects happening right now are happening in JavaScript and those working on the projects are very willing to share their knowledge.</li>
</ul>
I have to admit, I was not prepared for the reactions and excitement that this conference generated, but the response makes me a lot more confident in this conference. I am quite excited for it and the plans already, I can&#8217;t imagine where it is going to go from here. If you want to help out, please by all means contact us through the curator inquiry page on the site. We are trying to avoid sponsors similar to RubyFringe, but also would like to keep the price down, not entirely sure how we are going to pull off both - so please check the site often (as it does change almost daily).

			AJAX Head Design Pattern</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Ken Collins from MetaSkills originally <a href="http://www.metaskills.net/2008/5/24/the-ajax-head-br-design-pattern">posted on his blog</a> about the concept of an Ajax Head pattern in which he describes a pattern for providing a thin controller API that is responsible for initial GET response and all other actions beyond that are Boolean responses. He sums up the entire pattern, from his perspective, in a single quote:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">The AJAX head design pattern forces the view and controller to work in isolation with the most minimal coupling possible. Kind of like a web service.</blockquote>
<p>I have been working on several projects that are utilizing a variant, or as I would contend the resultant of this pattern, in very interesting and rewarding ways. I wanted to provide a more robust and implementation agnostic definition to the pattern, because I believe this pattern is quite revolutionary in the world of web programming. It serves well to resolve many of the issues that plague web application development since it focuses on isolation, encapsulation, and delegation of responsibilities. I have chosen to describe this pattern, as I view it, using the model set forth by the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0321127420">Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</a> by <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>. I encourage you to read through the pattern and suspend or at least delay your immediate reaction until after you try using the pattern. In all cases that I have used it, it has felt more natural, more dynamic, and surprisingly faster than the competitive pattern of embedding dynamic data into static templates at run time. Enjoy.</p>
<h2>AJAX Head</h2>
<p>Web Applications, like many enterprise applications, are composed of several layers of data processing in order to properly and meaningfully decompose the problem set into encapsulated components.These components are constructed in a fashion that they can be used by any layer above them without knowing the details of layers below them. This creates a contract between the consuming layer and the providing layer regarding the expectation details and not the implementation details. In web applications, the concept of layering commonly stops being applied after the Service Layer [Staffor, PEAA] and utilizes a mixture of embedded behavior, data, and structure that is rendered out to a specific interface format.</p>
<p>The AJAX Head pattern provides a thoughtful approach of how to maintain separation of behavior, data, and structure by extending the concept of layering into the user interface component. Furthermore, the AJAX Head pattern describes an implementation pattern that drastically modifies common web client-server interactions in order to bring them more closely in line with enterprise client-server interactions. This pattern relies heavily on the separation and isolation of responsibilities between components which yields better encapsulation and testability of each component.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>The AJAX Head Design Pattern can be implemented with any combination of server programming languages and client side languages, but does require that an Asynchronous JavaScript And XML connection can be established between the two endpoints (client-&gt;server). The basis of the pattern rests on the following key components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Statically defined HTML files that include single instance &#8220;templates&#8221; with sample data for all areas of the user interface that are meant to be dynamic. These HTML files should be descriptive of their intention through the use of proper and meaningful tags, identification, and classing derived from the specific domain. This layer is responsible for describing the structure and indicating the intention of the requestor. It provides &#8220;templates&#8221; for how the fulfillment of those intentions should be represented in order to be meaningful.</li>
<li>Statically defined JavaScript files that include behavior definitions of the HTML pages as well as the ability to query and parse the data feeds provided by the server. This layer is responsible for detecting the requested intention, describing the intention to the Service Layer, and applying the response to the defined structure.</li>
<li>A server side application programming interface (API) that can handle web service requests (XML-RPC, REST, SOAP, etc.) and produce standardized data responses appropriate for the request. The responses need to be in a format that is uniform across the API and retains the structure and composition of the data. Recommendations for this include JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), XML, or CSV. This layer is commonly referred to as the aforementioned Service Layer and is responsible for appropriate calling sub layers and performing any necessary processing in order to fulfill the intention.</li>
</ol>
<p>With these components the following workflow defines the process of rendering a single page:</p>
<ol>
<li>The browser requests a web page.</li>
<li>The server returns the static HTML page appropriate to the request.</li>
<li>The browser parses the HTML page and requests the necessary and appropriate JavaScript behavior definitions described by the HTML page.</li>
<li>Once interpreted by the browser, the JavaScript behaviors will query the server using AJAX for the appropriate data elements. These AJAX requests will be fulfilled with the defined data format based on the request.</li>
<li>The behavior definitions will parse the data feed and render the elements into the HTML structure based on the provided single item templates. If there are no items, the template is removed.</li>
<li>Interaction and behavior updates are applied to the new data elements as described in the behavior definitions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Differences From Other Patterns</strong> This differs tremendously from the embedded template pattern currently employed in most web application frameworks because it pushes all of the rendering down to the client system, distributing the load and strain on the server across the interacting components. This pattern leverages the prevalence and availability of network connectivity with the server to reverse the presentation work flow from render and serve to serve and render. This key difference allows for a natural separation and encapsulation between the components of the presentation system. It normalizes the user interface into an interaction interface through a standard API, thus enforcing and encouraging web service style development with true abstraction between the layers.</p>
<p><strong>Results</strong> A result of this separation is that all of the presentation components can be thoroughly tested in isolation and with automation. This is important because it not only facilitates isolated testing, but specifica and appropriate creation as well. It allows developers to develop the functional code, designers to design and construct the front end user interface components, and a intermediary programmer/designer to wire the two layers together without affecting or influencing the creation of either.  Since this design pattern abstracts the structure, behavior, and functional components from one another without a blending of components as occurs with embedded templates, the removal, replacement, or modification of one component does not adversely or greatly affect the others. If a backend is replaced with a different backend, it does not require a new user interface to be rewritten. If a new JavaScript libraries is chosen or replaced with a competitive technology (Flash, SilverLight, etc.) it does not require a modification of any other element. Finally, the changes in the HTML structure only need to be known and, if necessary, handled by the layer that interacts with it directly, so replacing it is as easy as the other two.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Variations</strong> As identified in the Ken Collins article, there is one variation of this pattern that requires the service layer to respond to requests with either an error explanation or a success, which in his case was a &#8220;200 OK&#8221; HTTP response. Another, more verbose implementation variation leaves the response content open to the API definition, since there are possible actions or calls that might change the state or attributes of an object beyond the appropriate knowledge of a behavior/requestor. The latter of these variations is recommended by the author.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Implementation Details</strong> Advanced details of this pattern can be applied iteratively over time and need not be implemented or provided all at once. These details are not necessary for all implementations, but are provided here for use in certain cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>The AJAX requests can be sent over multiple sub-domain names providing multiplexed requests for data. This provides substantial improvements in performance since the requests will be parallelized in the request, response, and rendering process.</li>
<li>Since all initiating components of the interaction sequence are statically defined and hold no sensitive data, they can be delivered not just by the server, but through a Content Distribution Network (CDN) for fast, highly distributed, and localized provision of the components.</li>
</ul>
<h3>When to Use It</h3>
<p>This design pattern can be used for any web application, even those requiring authentication or privileged access because the static HTML pages, which are publicly available, provide no &#8220;domain specific&#8221; data, only structure and style. All access is controlled and negotiated between the behavior and the controller layers. This pattern works sufficiently well for nearly all web applications and in most circumstances can replace all embedded templates in an application. It can also be intermingled with embedded templates since the pattern does not require complete and holistic application in order to obtain the benefits.</p>
<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>There is little prior art for this design pattern, though many JavaScript libraries have begun to head in this direction. I recommend reviewing the following libraries/frameworks that assist with the implementation of this design pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://beebole.com/blog/2008/10/02/our-javascript-template-pure-becomes-cross-library/">BeeBole Pure</a> - a Fast JavaScript Rendering Library.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/raid-ox/chain.js/wikis">Chain.js</a> - a jQuery library for data binding the elements of a feed to HTML.</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/voodootikigod/dissident/tree">Dissident</a> - a framework based in Erlang built from the ground up around the AJAX Head design pattern, this is still under construction by the author.</li>
</ul>

			Installing Erlang on Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I want to start this blog post out with a nod to the inspiration, the godfather of introductory installations - <a href="http://hivelogic.com/">Dan Benjamin</a>, who is most likely responsible for more than half of the installations of Ruby and Ruby on Rails on Mac OS X. His blog posts are always high educational and the model of what should be a technical blog post. I am going to use his post as a template for helping to drive this tutorial in a meaningful and worthwhile manner.</p>
<h2>Before We Start</h2>
<p>Although we are just installing software that should not do anything but enhance or add to your system, it is always a good idea to be safe and have a backup. Whether you do a full system back up with something like <a href="http://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/">SuperDuper!</a> or the always available Time Machine, make sure you have something to fall back on.  Second, we are installing from source during this installation because you can obtain a better tuned system by installing it manually instead of MacPorts or Fink. You can easily install the most recent version of Erlang through MacPorts using the single command:</p>
<p><code>sudo port install erlang</code></p>
<p>If you want to get coding Erlang quickly, then I recommend using MacPorts.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In order to install Erlang, you are going to need the following items available on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)</li>
<li>XCode 3.0 or newer</li>
<li>A comfort level with using the Mac OS X Terminal application. <em><strong>Note: </strong><span style="font-style: normal;">The remainder of this article assumes you are using the default bash shell that is provided with Mac OS X Leopard. If you are using something different than bash (like zsh, tcsh, or others) then you will need to look up the syntax mappings that are appropriate for your specific shell.</span></em></li>
</ul>

			Building an Erlang Application</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		Yesterday, September 27th, 2008, the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">Northern Virginia Languages</a> (NoVALang) Group held our big <a href="http://www.iterativedesigns.com/2008/8/12/announcing-the-great-erlang-out-event">erlang:out</a> event in which we spent a standard work day (9:00am - 5:30pm) working in small groups on Erlang projects. We learned an awful lot about working with Erlang including some of the pitfalls and problems that will infest your first couple projects. I wanted to write them down since Erlang seems to have a news article on hacker news every day.

When you think about starting down the path of developing an Erlang project, it can admittedly be a bit daunting. Even if you have read cover to cover the entire Pragmatic Programmers book, you are left thinking how do I start more than how to push forward. There is a lot of room in the Erlang world for utilities and tools that can help on this step, here are a couple ideas that we ran into as possible projects that would help out tremendously:
<ul>
	<li>A project structure generator that would create the appropriate and necessary OTP application directory structure and a standard makefile/emakefile/rakefile for the developer. </li>
	<li>A lot of tutorials for what seem to be great projects of <a href="http://www.erlware.org/tools/faxien/index.html">Faxien</a>, the RubyGems of Erlang, and <a href="http://www.erlware.org/tools/sinan/index.html">Sinan</a>, and better (but complex and convoluted) build system for OTP. I personally spent a lot of time trying to unravel the value versus process of the systems, which should have been used to build my app. Oh look a shiny object!</li>
	<li>A better project/concept modeling method for Erlang, the box and stick format does not work well with concurrent, message based process. I spent a lot of time trying to remember the process and not the components. I do love the marker on paper modeling that many <a href="http://code.google.com/p/geoping/">existing</a> <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/">Erlang</a> projects use, but aside for being &#8220;cute&#8221; they do not convey enough information to be meaningful. </li>
</ul>
We actually worked on two different projects during our erlang:out event, one was <a href="http://github.com/voodootikigod/dissident/wikis">Dissident</a>, a revolutionary web application system that marries the concurrency of Erlang with the asynchronous callbacks of Javascript, and an IRC system which was practically saying &#8220;write me! erlang was made for stuff like me!&#8221;. We took two completely different approaches, with Dissident I and Dave wanted to package up and make ready for wide distribution so we started with Sinan and the IRC team of <a href="http://seanmountcastle.com/">Sean</a> and Chris started by reviewing and extending existing code. 

I gave up on Sinan by Noon and decided to scrape the entire thing due to lack of tutorials and good documentation. I spent the next couple minutes revising the structure to be something I was more familiar with from the <a href="http://github.com/voodootikigod/telchat/">telchat</a> application I built before. Once on that footing, I fought with various cross binding issues with Faxien trying to &#8220;help me&#8221; but being more of a hinderance in the process. Eventually I got to a point where Dissident was binding on a configured network port and handling requests, but I had yet to build the router. I wasted a lot of time on things that didn&#8217;t work and want to recommend not using anything extra or new despite how &#8220;awesome&#8221; it may seem - it will just get in your way. I spent a bit of time last night hacking more on dissident and its now moving smoothly.

The IRC team tried to extend several versions of existing code bases, but none seemed to actually get to the point and spent a lot of code to extend behaviors and create new behaviors and so forth. They actually ended up using the aforementioned telchat as a base to extend and grow into a full IRC server. 

All in all, the pure Erlang knowledge we had was enough to build an application, but there seems to be a plateau that we haven&#8217;t overcome after reading the book and watching the screencasts. There are many articles that make it seem easy to create awesome applications, but there is equally a dearth of articles on how to go from idea to app. Some of the aforementioned ideas, either better documents, more automation, or just more articles, will greatly help developers move from introductory level interactions with the system through the erl shell to actually building full applications.

I am going to press forward with Erlang because I truly believe in the potential it has, but I am still going to move forward with NoVALang on to the next language. I plan on investigating more of Faxien and Sinan because they will be critical to the Erlang community&#8217;s growth and adoption. Also check my next post for follow up on getting on hacker news and being a blog troll!

Good then lets get started!

Open up your text editor of choice or an IDE if you have nothing else and create a new file called <strong>sample.erl</strong>, because I am really not all that creative. In the editor type (or copy and paste if you are lazy) the following code:

<code>-module(sample).</code>

<code>factorial(0) -&gt; 1;
factorial(N) -&gt; N * factorial(N-1).</code>

WATCH FOR THOSE PERIODS, they are only kind of important. Most Erlang code is based around an optimized pattern matching process, which will take a fair amount of time to get used to, its alright if you don&#8217;t get it on the first go around. What this is doing is defining a method &#8220;factorial&#8221; with &#8220;1&#8221; parameter, which represented in Erlang notation as <strong>factorial/1</strong> within the module &#8220;sample&#8221;. Now notice the two definitions of factorial/1: factorial(0) and factorial(N). This is where the pattern matching occurs so follow me here.

The pattern factorial(0) will match and return 1 whenever factorial is called with a parameter of zero (0) and the pattern factorial(N) will whenever factorial is called with any non-zero parameter. factorial(N) will return N multiplied by the return value of factorial(N-1), which recurses back into the factorial function. Note if they were reverse, the pattern factorial(0) would be meaningless and never matched because the variable N would match both any non-zero and zero parameter. This is pretty crazy, so if you don&#8217;t get it its ok, you can leave your question in the comments and I or other readers can help you out with this. Just look at the code, embrace the period, the semicolon, and those wacky arrows. Swoon.

Now open a terminal/command window and change your directory to the directory that contains the sample.erl file you made (psst that&#8217;s cd &lt;directorypath&gt;). Type &#8220;erl&#8221; in order to open an Erlang Read, Execute, Print, Loop or REPL shell. This is a limited environment that you can use to enter commands and interact with the Erlang VM. It is not full featured, but for now, it will suffice. When you hit enter the following should appear

<code>Erlang (BEAM) emulator version 5.6.3 [source] [smp:8] [async-threads:0] [kernel-poll:false]
Eshell V5.6.3  (abort with ^G)
1&gt;
</code>

If not, well post a comment and I will try to help you one on one. Now you are officially in the Erlang. We need to compile our code so we want to enter the following after the 1&gt; in our REPL shell:

<code>c(sample).</code>

Once again, watch for that period, it symbolizes the end of a statement just like a sentence in English. It is very, very important. With that statement, Erlang went looking for the file sample.erl in the local directory, found it, compiled it, and loaded it into the execution environment all with one letter, pretty cool. The REPL shell will output the following

<code>
{ok,sample}
2&gt;
</code>

Now type in <code>sample:factorial(6).</code> into the REPL shell and you should get a result of 720.

Way to go on your first Erlang program, see that wasn&#8217;t that hard or crazy. To leave the REPL shell, type

<code>q().
</code>
Remember the period.

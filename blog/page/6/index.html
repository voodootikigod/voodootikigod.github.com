			NoSQL: A Modest Proposal</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>The NoSQL movement was coined to describe the variety of revolutionary data storage engines and techniques being aggressively developed to address massive and dynamic data sets. The rise in trending for non-traditional data storage techniques has seen a breadth and depth of variety of new technologies, ideas, and most importantly innovation that solves specific problems as datasets at scale. The largest of web applications have either included or switched to one of the following data storage engines that are capable of working with massive data in an elegant fashion (elegance is defined within terms of the target domain):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/">Cassandra</a></li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/redis/">Redis</a></li>
<li><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a></li>
<li><a href="http://riak.basho.com/">Riak</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.github.com/cliffmoon/dynomite">Dynomite</a></li>
<li><a href="http://neo4j.org/">Neo4J</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There is very little that generally describes these technologies, they each accomplish &#8220;data-at-scale&#8221; through different techniques (<a href="http://camelcase.blogspot.com/2007/08/cap-theorem.html">CAP Theorem</a>, Collection Oriented, Column Oriented, and Key-Value) and optimize for different workflow processes. One data storage does not rule them all, but they all represent something different from &#8220;traditional solutions&#8221; like MySQL, PostrgreSQL, DB2, SQL Server, and Oracle. These solutions have dominated the data storage component of applications for many years and in many environments and work great for certain workflows. The problem is that these solutions became a golden hammer for which any data storage problem was a nail and thus SQL became the &#8220;only choice&#8221; for data solutions. This has been further exacerbated with the consolidation of various SQL implementations by vendors purchasing one another in a constant battle to be the &#8220;one&#8221; solution as well as a rampant and generally unchecked marketing drive to ensure SQL&#8217;s continued dominance in the market.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because of this David versus Goliath battle that the NoSQL movement embraced such a &#8220;rebellious&#8221; name - it&#8217;s easier to band together a group of people with mild differences if you can demonize a single opponent or group of opponents. This is typical for many &#8220;new concepts&#8221;, both in technology and otherwise, and has been historically advantageous for a small ragtag group to gain wider favor. Case in point, <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> would have been relegated to the &#8216;Yet Another Framework&#8217; category except that it was able to rally against the burning dynamo of Java and Enterprise by demonizing it. In the Rails case, by the leaders implying that everything &#8220;enterprisey&#8221; or &#8220;professional&#8221; was evil without consequence or concern led to quite a following until eventually &#8220;The Enterprise&#8221; became Rails and Rails became &#8220;The Enterprise&#8221;, of course not without abusive language and various less-than-professional presentations. Neither here nor there, this is not about Rails, its about a rebellious movement against what the name &#8220;SQL&#8221; has stood for and less about the Structured Query Language itself. Hence the name NoSQL became a moniker that simultaneously drew together the disparate tribes of next generation data storage AND identified and demonized the opposition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In The Name of &#8220;SQL&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Traditional solutions are commonly generalized to their most common element, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">Structured Query Langauge</a> (SQL) that is used to query the data. For the most part that is the only common link between the wide variety of &#8220;SQL&#8221; based data storage engines. One might argue that, and properly so, that common SQL implementations all provide for a method of persisting relationships between data, but the specific means of implementation vary. Case in point, Foreign Keys, the standard means of associating one data element to another, are not common or enforced in all SQL implementations, in fact the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/myisam-storage-engine.html">MyISAM</a> storage engine in MySQL disregards Foreign Key Constraints entirely. The path of defining a classification of data storage techniques is ill begotten from the start because each database is its own beast, with benefits and downsides that overlap and stand disjoint. The common term of a SQL database, in fact, tells you very little about the database except that you might have some vague intuition of how to query it if you have use any other SQL database, but if you use the data storage in any manner beyond trivial you are forced into niche syntax specific to the engine you are using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I draw this out because most people view the NoSQL movement as a rage against the classification of databases known to be SQL-compliant or the syntax employed to query said databases - it isn&#8217;t. At least no more so than Rails was raging against the &#8220;Enterprise&#8221; when few if any of them had really worked in the <a href="http://www.usajobs.gov/">THE ENTERPRISE</a> for any period of time. NoSQL, like Rails, is raging against the dominance of a beast that has for a period of time been unchecked, out of control, and applied in far too many ill appropriate ways. NoSQL is not a&nbsp;revolution against the Structured Query Language any more so than <a href="http://therealadam.com/archive/2009/08/31/its-not-nosql-its-post-relational/">Adam&#8217;s proffered suggestion of &#8220;Post-Relational&#8221;</a> is a revolution against the relational model and normalized data forms - that, my friends, would be ludicrous. &nbsp;Especially since various engines the movement either embrace the SQL syntax, but just as many if not more, deeply embrace the concept of relationships even through the guise of embedding of data. We are not &#8220;after relationships&#8221;, in fact we are finally getting to a point where they are just now being useful at scale. And there is that word again, at scale.</p>
<p><strong>What is in a Name?</strong></p>
<p>NoSQL will for a time remain to be called NoSQL, either over Twitter or in backrooms filled with beer, coffee, and laptops. Let&#8217;s be honest here #postrelational is ridiculous especially if you are going to re-tweet it or talk about it in public. The modern era of naming is driven by small, tight, and descriptive terms. Furthermore it fails to accomplish the goals set forth by its inventor of defining the movement in terms of itself, its virtues, and its abilities instead of on the attributes of SQL. Defining the movement as either NoSQL or PostRelational is still a definition in terms of &#8220;SQL&#8221; and its &#8220;failures&#8221;, further the term &#8220;post&#8221; implies that SQL is somehow run its course or is over - which is very much not true and will remain so for as far as I care to peer into the future without a DeLorean. The naming of the movement needs to be something both descriptive and meaningful, broadly appealing yet concise, and most important defined in terms of itself.</p>
<p><em>While I personally am not a fan of Post-Relational, I greatly applaud Adam for starting the discussion and putting forth an idea.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>My Ever Depreciating American Two Cents</strong></p>
<p>We seem to be at a naming impasse with few alternative suggestions and while I do love complaining, I have learned that complaints without plausible solutions is just veiled trolling. I don&#8217;t roll like that. Here are my suggestions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>We get a group to come up with the name of interested parties. This is similar to what was done for the renaming of the ServerJS group to CommonJS, everyone of interest and importance was present, threw in their ideas, group votes, and its done. Print T-Shirts, badges, various little handouts on why we switched names, and its done. Having people write blogs or twitter posts throwing out ideas is like crapping your pants, it just stinks. My main suggestion is that (and with a little self promotion admittedly) we make a point at the upcoming <a href="http://nosqleast.com/2009/">NoSQL East conference</a> to plan a discussion on renaming the movement. Either be there in person or be there on IRC, which ever serves you best. We take an hour spit board ideas and make a decision as a movement and rally behind it. Hurt feelings are left at the door.</li>
<li>We would be remiss as a body of intellectuals to exclude or preclude the revolutionary and transformative changes occurring around us in the &#8220;messaging&#8221; space with RestMS, AMQP, and the others. These, and the current NoSQL movement, seek a common goal: Better widely available technology for high scale with limited or predictable infrastructure requirements. Its all about data. Where NoSQL is dealing with storage or querying, messaging deals with movement and action. ITS JUST DATA. Joining the movements would not be a bad idea as they are conceptually supportive of one another.</li>
<li>The name should be something refreshing, expressive, and concise. Might sound a little marketing like, but here are my suggestions to get the ideas going:&nbsp;   
<ul>
<li>CloudData&nbsp;</li>
<li>WebScale&nbsp;</li>
<li>Big Data&nbsp;</li>
<li>NoORACLE Movement (purely a joke, but possibly)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</ol>

		<a href="/the-real-y-combinator-in-javascript/">
		
			The Real Y-Combinator (in JavaScript)</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I want to get to this eventually in <a href="http://www.nakedjavascript">Naked JavaScript</a>, but for the time being I wanted to share a great little code bit with you in JavaScript. Also given <a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2009/08/30/tail-call-optimization">Paul&#8217;s recent post</a>, I decided it would be good to continue the functional JavaScript by providing a different, way off accomplishing tail call optimization. As I <a href="http://voodootikigod.com/paul-barry-shows-how-to-accomplish-tail-call">mentioned previously</a>, JavaScript has a strict limit on the call stack of around 1,000 entries (varies based on interpreter implementation) which commonly prevents any level of deep recursion, especially if writing portable JavaScript for multiple browsers. Paul&#8217;s method of leveraging an accumulator wrapped in a closure is a great method for accomplishing a recursive task in a stack or memory constrained environment. So great in fact that the basic pattern of detecting repetition and translating it to a linear fashion is very similar to the underpinnings of what <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/JavaScript:TraceMonkey">TraceMonkey</a> automatically accomplishes using <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/%7Efranz/Site/pubs-pdf/ICS-TR-06-16.pdf">Trace Trees</a>.</p>
<p>From Paul&#8217;s description of the problem at hand, we are trying to find the odds of becoming the next&nbsp;mega-millionare. The following is the imperative solution provided by Paul using a variable to accumulate the odds at any given step in the process as the multiple of the previous value and the new expression result.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/178832.js"></script></p>
<p>Paul presents the conversion of this code segment to a simple recursive function that will help us to find the value of by calling the function over and over with varying values defined within the function until a termination clause is reached. In this case the termination clause is when the variable n equals the value 0.</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/178842.js"></script></p>
<p>With the basic code from those two examples and a utility for the spell books of lambda calculus, we can actually create a recursive function and then apply it to the exercise. Mind you that this will still suffer from the aforementioned call stack limitations placed on the JavaScript VM due to its applicative nature, and realistically there are far better ways for obtaining the same result (one of which shown at the end), but to hell with all that.</p>
<p>By using a technique known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator">Fixed Point Combinator</a>, and specifically a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_point_combinator#Y_combinator">Y-Combinator</a>&nbsp;we will not on obtain the result but build recursion without using a named function. To begin, a Fixed Point Combinator is a special type of higher order function that has the unique transitive property that for any function <strong>F </strong>and value <strong>V</strong>, the value of the Y-Combinator function <strong>G </strong>when passed the parameter <strong>F</strong> will return the value <strong>V</strong> which is the same value as when <strong>V</strong> is passed to <strong>F</strong>. Lost? Lets look at this description as a the transitive function definition:</p>
<p>[code]F(G(F)) == G(F)[/code]</p>
<p>The definition of a combinator relies on the lazy evaluation of functions in order to allow a function to be defined in terms of itself, often times referred to as <em>anonymous recursion</em>. This requires a deep understanding or interest in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">lambda calculus</a> and this function is deviously complex and compact. For more details about a Y-Combinator, which is a specific formula of a Fixed Point Combinator, <a href="http://www.ece.uc.edu/~franco/C511/html/Scheme/ycomb.html">look here</a>.&nbsp;Let us look at it as a JavaScript function:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/178862.js"></script></p>
<p>This definition is from <a href="http://blog.jcoglan.com/2008/01/10/deriving-the-y-combinator/">The If Works</a> and happens to be one of the most compact, but readable implementations I have seen and it even slips a couple extra JavaScript specific enhancements to make it even more flexible. The definition of this function is near exact to the formulaic definition described in Scheme from the link above with one key advantage. Using the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/arguments">arguments</a></em>&nbsp;object in combination with the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply">apply</a></em> function that is available on functions, we can make this more flexible than the one described in <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/little.html">The Little JavaScripter</a> by <a href="http://javascript.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>&nbsp;by allowing it to handle any number of arguments passed in.</p>
<p>With this definition of a Y-Combinator, let us revise the original problem set using the code from the recursive definition. The most important part that we can take from the recursive definition is the conditional logic, in fact that is all we will be taking. The Y-Combinator version of this looks like this:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/178878.js"></script></p>
<p>Which looks similar to the recursive definition and it really should, because all we have done is create recursion using anonymous functions instead of named functions. As I said earlier, this method is most likely not going to win you fame or fortune (but if it does I claim 5% of the winnings), &nbsp;it is however a great example of the functional capabilities of the JavaScript programming language. All that said, here is probably the most terse definition of this function I could devise:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/178887.js"></script></p>

			Paul Barry Shows How to Accomplish Tail Call Optimization in JavaScript</a>

<blockquote>
<p />
</blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">Local Polyglot Extraordinare, <a href="http://www.paulbarry.com">Paul Barry</a>&nbsp;has been on a JavaScript spree of late, especially in showing how JavaScript compares to other full functional programming languages like Clojure, Haskell, and Erlang. <a href="http://paulbarry.com/articles/2009/08/30/tail-call-optimization">In his most recent article</a>, he goes about showing how to use the accumulator pattern, from the SICP book if I am not mistaken, to accomplish Tail Call Optimization in JavaScript. One of the things he doesn&#8217;t mention and is a known issue with JavaScript in most interpreters is that after around 1,000 recursive calls the interpreter will exception out the execution regardless. This is done based purely on the call stack and not on memory usage in an (vain) attempt to be protective in nature due to the &#8220;constrained&#8221; client environment and operating sandbox of JavaScript. It more often then not becomes a pain in the tail (recursion) in the modern era where people have more than 64kb of memory. That said, Paul&#8217;s technique is a great one that is widely applicable in many formats, not just JavaScript.</span></h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s hoping he continues to love the JS and what he is doing that has transpired these recent posts.</p>

I have had the pleasure to meet and <a href="http://weblog.hypotheticalabs.com/?p=391">hang out with Kevin previously</a>&nbsp;and I can promise you that this meeting is one not to miss you have any interest in highly scalable and highly capable web environments. In case you think you have never heard of Kevin Smith, or maybe have him confused with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0003620/">someone in the entertainment business</a>, let me introduce you to him and the wonders of Erlang. Kevin is based out of Raleigh, NC and runs his own company, <a href="http://www.hypotheticalabs.com/">Hypothetical Labs</a>, after recently leaving the great <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a>. He is responsible for introducing a large portion of the Ruby on Rails world to the <a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kserl/erlang-in-practice">power, beauty, and capability of Erlang through his Pragmatic Programmer Screencast series</a>, which to this day still remains the best way to learn erlang (minus the Hands On Erlang class that he needs to do again). I have verified his &#8220;NOVALANG&#8221; ability and believe that his talk and the impending happy hour to one of the highest points of the DC technology scene - you have to be there!</p>
<p>The combined forces of <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/novalanguages">NOVALANG</a>, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/erlang/members/">Erlang Users of Arlington/DC</a>, and Alt.NET DC are presenting this great presentation to you hosted by the great people at <a href="http://www.fool.com">The Motley Fool</a>. The meeting will begin on at 7:00pm at 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314 and will be followed with a happy hour(s), so bring your NOVALANG adult beverage face. Hope to see you there, I will be posting an intro to Erlang so people are completely lost &#8211; hopefully sometime this weekend, but more likely next weekend.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/erlang/calendar/11052302/"><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">Please confirm your attendance so we have some idea of the number of people and see you there!</span></strong></a></p>

Brad and I have been discussing this event for quite some time so it is great to see it finally launch and begin to announce it to everyone. The main focus of the conference will be highly scalable, non-relational databases of all sorts and variety, but the most important part of the event will be gathering people like you together. We are bringing together some of the brightest minds we can get access to and &nbsp;providing them a podium to present their ideas and technologies to you. This event will definitely blow your mind if you haven&#8217;t had the chance to dabble with any of the various non-relational&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">databases and it will definitely be the greatest learning opportunity for anyone working with or near &#8220;Big Data&#8221;. Check out the highly impressive <a href="http://nosqleast.com/2009/#speakers">list of confirmed speakers</a> that will present on topics ranging from <a href="http://mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> to <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> to <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/">Cassandra</a> and the recently released <a href="http://riak.basho.com/">Riak</a>. If you are a programmer, regardless of your language of choice, this conference is for you!</span></p>

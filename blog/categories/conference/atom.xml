    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As being the curator of JSConf, I see a lot of new names and exciting topics during the Call For Speakers process, but unfortunately we only have 20-24 slots available for speakers. If I could I would have everyone speak all the time! Luckily there are hundreds of JS meetup groups happening all across the USA and thousands across the world - it is an exciting time. We, the JSConf team, wanted to make a way to help these JS meetup groups connect with the people that register for the Call for Speakers of JSConf (US|EU|..) that might even live or work right next door to them.</p>


<p>And so the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGN0MEVOMUVVRVVtT2lOR1kwdTJJblE6MQ">Regional JS Speaker Directory</a> was born.</p>


<p>Initially this is targeting local JS meetup groups, but could very easily be used to help curate amazing local content for various <a href="http://2011.texasjavascript.com/">regional</a> <a href="http://capitoljs.com/">JS</a> <a href="http://reddirtjs.com/">conferences</a>. For now, we are just gathering details about speakers, but we will be curating that list and providing them to regionally based meetup organizers as part of JSConf US 2012. This will hopefully get people talking with one another and allowing all these amazing talks happen across the USA and eventually the world. This is a pretty exciting initiative for us and for the JS community so anything you can do to help us would be greatly appreciated. At the very least, be sure to&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGN0MEVOMUVVRVVtT2lOR1kwdTJJblE6MQ">sign yourself up</a>!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today <a href="http://twitter.com/boorad">Brad Anderson</a>&nbsp;from <a href="http://cloudant.com/">Cloudant</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/mattpodwysocki">Matthew Podwysocki</a> from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a>, and myself announced the first ever <a href="http://nosqleast.com/2009/">NoSQL East</a> conference to be held October 28th - 30th, 2009 in Atlanta, GA. This conference will be the extension of the very successful and&nbsp;highly disruptive&nbsp;<a href="http://nosql.eventbrite.com/">NoSQL meetup</a> held June 11th, 2009 in San Francisco - we just couldn't let "The Valley" have all the fun! Brad and I have been discussing this event for quite some time so it is great to see it finally launch and begin to announce it to everyone. The main focus of the conference will be highly scalable, non-relational databases of all sorts and variety, but the most important part of the event will be gathering people like you together. We are bringing together some of the brightest minds we can get access to and &nbsp;providing them a podium to present their ideas and technologies to you. This event will definitely blow your mind if you haven't had the chance to dabble with any of the various non-relational&nbsp;<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">databases and it will definitely be the greatest learning opportunity for anyone working with or near "Big Data". Check out the highly impressive <a href="http://nosqleast.com/2009/#speakers">list of confirmed speakers</a> that will present on topics ranging from <a href="http://mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> to <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> to <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/cassandra/">Cassandra</a> and the recently released <a href="http://riak.basho.com/">Riak</a>. If you are a programmer, regardless of your language of choice, this conference is for you!</span></p>
